        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>WICS is a student group supporting women and gender minorities in computer science. Our aim is to make computer science less intimidating and create a safe space for women to connect. A few events we host are workshops and panels on topics like website development, co-op program tips, and achieving success. This past year, our outreach team collaborated with CanU to host workshops dedicated for middle school and high school students. In the past, we have also collaborated with big companies like Bold, IQmetrix, Ubisoft, and Amazon to build a stronger community for gender minorities.</p>
